# Auth0 - GoLang

In this repository, you'll find all the information about integrating Auth0 with GoLang.

You can read how to create [Regular WebApps with Go](https://docs.auth0.com/server-platforms/golang) or how to create [APIs with GO](https://docs.auth0.com/server-apis/golang)

Check out the examples that we have in here in our `examples` folder. Each of them has a README on how to run them and on how to use them.
